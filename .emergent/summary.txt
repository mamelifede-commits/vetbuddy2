**original_problem_statement**:
The user's primary goals for this session are to finalize the application's branding and the Coming Soon landing page.

**Specific User Requests**:
1.  **Coming Soon Page Design (Highest Priority)**: The user has rejected multiple design proposals (including one with animal photos in circular frames and a minimalist one). They now have a very specific request:
    *   A single, high-quality, cutout (transparent background) image of an animal.
    *   This animal should have a simple, elegant animation, rising from the bottom of the page.
    *   The animation should stop just below the three dashes under the Coming Soon text.

2.  **Logo and Branding Consistency**: The user wants their chosen logo (Style 4 - Minimal) and branding (vetbuddy) applied consistently across the entire application. They have pointed out specific remaining issues:
    *   **Invoice PDFs**: The logo/brand name is incorrect. A user-provided screenshot shows it as VetBuddy.
    *   **Tutorial PDFs**: The logo/brand name is incorrect. A user-provided screenshot shows it as vet buddy (with a space).
    *   **Hidden Landing Page**: The user wants to verify the logo on the full landing page, which is currently hidden behind the Coming Soon feature flag.

**User's preferred language**: Italian. The next agent MUST respond in Italian.

**what currently exists?**
The agent has successfully refactored the main logo component () to use the new Style 4 - Minimal design. This change has been propagated through most of the application's UI, including the login form, user dashboards (clinic, owner), and welcome screens.

However, the Coming Soon page is in a state of flux. After the user rejected several designs, the agent attempted to implement a single animated animal but ran into technical difficulties (image not appearing, page not loading). The current live version shown in the last screenshot is a minimalist fallback design with decorative shapes, which the user has also rejected.

Branding fixes for generated PDFs were attempted, but user feedback indicates they were not successful.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent was about to address the user's latest, very specific feedback from message #196: fix the PDF logos and re-implement the Coming Soon page with a single animated animal.
-   Status: NOT STARTED
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent for the visual animation on the Coming Soon page (using the screenshot tool is critical). Manual verification of the generated PDF files is required to confirm the branding fix.
-   User Testing Done: N

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1: Implement Single Animated Animal on Coming Soon Page (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The user wants a single, cutout animal to animate from the bottom of the page and stop under the text. The agent's previous attempt to implement this failed; the image did not appear correctly, and the page experienced loading issues.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent tried hotlinking a PNG, which resulted in a silhouette. They then downloaded a transparent PNG to  and tried to animate it, but it failed to render, possibly due to CSS positioning, z-index, or animation cycle issues.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Open  and locate the  component.
        2.  Remove the current fallback design with decorative shapes.
        3.  Re-add the  tag for the locally stored animal image (e.g., ). Verify the path is correct.
        4.  Create a simple CSS  animation for . The animation should move the element from off-screen () to its final position.
        5.  Apply the animation to the image. Use  to ensure it stays in its final position.
        6.  Ensure the image has a proper  to appear above the background gradient but below the main text content.
        7.  Use the  to verify the final visual outcome and animation state.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the user's primary visual requirement for the landing page. Fulfilling it will unblock the project and align the page with the user's vision.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

-   **Issue 2: Incorrect Branding in Invoice PDF (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The user reported that generated invoices still show VetBuddy instead of the new branding.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent modified  to change the text from  to . This fix was insufficient.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Open .
        2.  Find the line that renders the brand text (e.g., ).
        3.  The user's screenshot shows VetBuddy. The agent's fix was to make it lowercase. The next agent should clarify with the user or implement the two-color text style seen in the UI (e.g., draw vet in black and buddy in coral) for better brand consistency.
        4.  Check if any caching mechanism could be serving an old version of the file.
        5.  After applying a new fix, a test invoice must be generated and checked.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Ensures brand consistency in official documents sent to customers.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Backend (PDF generation)
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

-   **Issue 3: Incorrect Branding in Tutorial PDF (P0)**
    -   **Description**: The user reported that generated tutorials show vet buddy (with a space) instead of vetbuddy.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent modified  to change VetBuddy to vetbuddy, but this might not have addressed the vet buddy variant.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Open .
        2.  Search for the exact string .
        3.  Replace it with the correct branding. Consider implementing the two-color text style here as well for consistency.
        4.  Generate a test tutorial PDF to verify the fix.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Ensures brand consistency in instructional materials.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Backend (PDF generation)
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Refactor **: Once the Coming Soon page is finalized, the highest priority is to break down the monolithic  file into smaller, manageable components for each dashboard and page.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2: Address Core Application Bugs**: Begin working through the original list of bugs (Stripe payments, appointment booking, document uploads, etc.) that were deferred.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Major Refactor: Logo Unification**:
    -   Replaced the old logo SVG with the new Style 4 component in .
    -   Successfully propagated the new logo across most UI components, including:
        -   Login/Auth forms ()
        -   All Dashboards (Clinic, Owner, Admin)
        -   Welcome Screen and Chat Widget
        -   Hidden full landing page and presentation page.
-   **Iterative Design on Coming Soon Page**:
    -   Implemented and presented multiple design variations based on user feedback (circular images, symmetrical layouts).
-   **PDF Branding Updates**:
    -   Attempted to standardize the brand name text in , , , and . (Note: These fixes were incomplete and need to be revisited).

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   The original list of core application bugs remains unaddressed: Stripe payments, appointment booking availability, document uploads, messaging attachments, pet profile issues, etc.

**Code Architecture**
-   **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
-   **Frontend**: Heavily concentrated in , which contains multiple dashboards and pages as large components. Some shared components exist under .
-   **Backend**: Monolithic API file at .
-   **Database**: Remote MongoDB Atlas.
-   **Static Assets**:  contains images for the landing page.

**All files of reference**
-   : CRITICAL file containing the  component and all dashboards.
-   : The central, updated logo component.
-   : Needs a fix for the brand name.
-   : Needs a fix for the brand name.
-   : The image to be used for the animation.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **CRITICAL**:  must be broken down into separate files for each page/dashboard (, , etc.) to improve maintainability.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **DEVI RISPONDERE IN ITALIANO.**
-   The user is visually oriented and has very specific design requirements. **Do not deviate from their latest request in message #196.**
-   Your first priority is to implement the **single animated animal** on the Coming Soon page. The user wants a clean, elegant animation of a cutout animal rising from the bottom. Refer to the debug checklist for a path forward. Use screenshots to confirm the result with the user.
-   Your second priority is to fix the branding in the **Invoice and Tutorial PDFs**. The previous text replacement was not enough. Investigate and fix the issue, then confirm how to verify the fix (e.g., how to trigger a PDF generation).
-   The user wants to see the hidden landing page. Temporarily set  in the  file, take a screenshot of the full landing page to show the user the logo is correct, and then **remember to set it back to **.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   **#196 (USER):** (PENDING) Explicitly rejected the current minimalist design. Requested a single, cutout animal animating from the bottom up. Also pointed out that the logos in the invoice and tutorial PDFs are still wrong (with screenshots) and asked for a preview of the hidden landing page.
-   **#137 (USER):** (ADDRESSED, BUT REJECTED) Hated the symmetrical multi-animal design (la preview è orrenda!), pivoting the request to a single animated animal.
-   **#104 (USER):** (PARTIALLY ADDRESSED) Pointed out that the brochure/hidden landing page needed checking and that the animal bubble composition was messy (fatta a casaccio). The agent addressed the composition and checked the pages, but the user then changed the entire design direction.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**:
    -   The Coming Soon page design does not meet user requirements.
    -   Branding in generated PDF documents (invoices, tutorials) is incorrect.
-   **Architectural Debt**:
    -   **CRITICAL**: The frontend logic is almost entirely in the monolithic .

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Resend (Emails)**: Assumed to be working.
-   **Stripe (Payments)**: Reported as broken in the initial problem statement, not addressed in this session.
-   **MongoDB Atlas (Database)**: Working.
-   **Next-Auth/Google (Authentication)**: Working.

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: None.
-   Known regressions: Branding in generated PDFs is still incorrect despite attempts to fix it. The Coming Soon page design has been rejected multiple times.
